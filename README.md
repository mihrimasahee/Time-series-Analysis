# Time-series-Analysis
# the final results of this time series analysis model and what is the best model to fit for predictions
**Accuracy:**

- The SVM model has the highest accuracy (close to 1), while ARIMA has a negative accuracy, indicating poor performance.

**MSE, RMSE, and MAE:**

- The SVM model has the lowest values for all error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE), indicating it is the best-performing model.

- ARIMA has the highest error values, confirming its poor performance.

**Comparison:**

- The plot allows for easy comparison of the models across multiple metrics.

- **SVM is the best model overall, followed by RF and LSTM, while ARIMA performs poorly.**
